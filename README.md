# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-2023-Nigerian-Presidential-Election

Introduction This is one of the early projects I worked on during my journey into data science, where I explored the 2023 Nigerian Presidential Election results. Although it’s been a while since I created it, I’ve decided to revisit and share it now to showcase my growth and the kind of data storytelling I was building at the time.  
🔍 "Sometimes, looking back shows how far you have come."

📌 Project Overview
In this project, I performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the official results of the 2023 Nigerian Presidential Elections. The goal was to uncover insights, voting patterns, and voter turnout across different states using Python and visualization libraries.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy – for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle Kernels

Kaggle Dataset – Official INEC Election Results (2023)

📊 Key Explorations
Voter turnout across different states

Party performance breakdown (APC, PDP, LP, NNPP, etc.)

Top performing states by party

Comparative bar charts and state-by-state visualizations

Distribution of valid vs invalid votes

🔍 Insights Discovered
Some states had unusually high or low voter turnout, prompting questions on logistics or security.

The Labour Party had a surprisingly strong showing in regions historically dominated by the PDP or APC.

North vs South regional voting patterns were visibly different, with interesting demographic implications.

Why I am Sharing It Now
As someone who has grown tremendously since this project, I find value in showcasing not just where I am now but where I started. This project was one of my first attempts at:

Storytelling with data

Asking political and societal questions with numbers

Understanding real world election data and the insights they hold

I am proud of the effort and curious mindset that led to this analysis, and I believe it reflects both initiative and early passion in civic data.

💡 What I would Improve Today
If I were to revisit this project now, I would:

Structure the analysis with clearer modular functions

Use Plotly for interactive charts

Add a dashboard in Power BI or Streamlit

Perform sentiment analysis from news sources alongside election data
